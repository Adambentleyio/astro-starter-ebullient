### I’ve given myself a little internal challenge of sitting down every weekday and writing something. Anything will do.

First thing, with a coffee, in bed. It’s quite a bougie little ritual if I do say so myself. Terrible for my stomach, but enjoyable nonetheless.
It doesn’t even have to eventually get published (which I know it will cause I can’t bloody help myself).
But the point is the challenge itself.
And it serves 3 main purposes…

1. The practice: I am a writer. I do it for my real job and have written for pleasure since I was a kid. Although I’m not what I would consider well-practised - or anywhere as near as ‘good’ as I could be. This is simply because I’ve not put in my 10,000 hours of intentional practice...yet.
2. To get ahead of the inner critic: the one that creeps its way into your mind as soon as you wake up, before the coffee is brewed, before the laptop is open and says “there’s no point, no one will ever read it, so why waste your time?” Actually sitting down and typing quietens the critic. Cause once the words start to pour - the criticism is irrelevant. I’m already enjoying the practice (see point no. 1).
3. And to pay yourself first: As you’ll come to learn by reading my nonsense, I love talking about money. I find it absolutely fascinating. And there’s this notion in the personal finance world of ‘paying yourself first’.

What that means is, as soon as you get paid, put some money aside into your savings account before you settle up the rest of your bills.
You’re putting money away that future you will, inevitably, need and you’ll be extremely grateful for it when the time comes. It’s proactive future-proofing. The same goes for doing something you enjoy before you start the rest of your day.
And as a recovering people pleaser, that 3rd one is arguably the most important.

**“Create before you consume.” - Marie Forleo**

For me, Marie Forleo is an absolute Queen of Life, I love her in so many ways I can’t even describe. And this mantra is so simple and incredibly effective.
We take in a lot of information throughout the day, whether that’s on our phones or in meetings, from our kids (arguably the worst offenders), our friends. And that influences how you think and feel.
So create something before anyone else’s influence gets a hold on your mind…that’s where the good stuff lives.

### 3.5 Ways To Get Over Your Fear Of Failure

If I’ve learned anything from coaching people, it’s this:
The thing you think it is. It’s not that.
It never is.

The story we tell ourselves is very often a complete rationalisation of how we actually feel about something. And a lot of coaching is just figuring out what’s behind the story.

There’s this notion called the 5 whys. It was developed by Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of Toyota, in the 1930s.
Toyota has a "go and see" philosophy. This means that its decision-making is based on an in-depth understanding of what's actually happening. The trick with this notion is that the answer you give to the ‘why’ must be grounded in fact - or as factually correct as you can be.

Ask yourself why: write it down. Repeat the process 5 times with each new answer that pops up.

Create before you consume: what is the first thing you do when you wake up? I’m going to guess it has something to do with the small little computer that lives by your bed. Well, imma tell you right now that shit needs to stop. And that note is just as much for me as it is for you. There’s no end to the number of people telling us not to look at our phones first thing. We know it’s bad. And yet, we still do it.

Identify what you’re actually afraid of: what is the worst-case scenario of the thing you want to do? Go as far and as mental as you possibly can. Is it that you’ll go bankrupt and be homeless? Is that how far this fear goes? Or does it stop before then?
Once you have your worst-case scenario work backwards to fix it.

What would you do if you knew the worst-case was coming?

How would you stop it?

Would you move back home?

Or stay on a friend’s couch while you got back on track?

Because the reality is, most of the things you want won’t take you that far.
As a lot of us fear the judgement of other people way more than becoming bankrupt and homeless.
And to be quite frank, screw the judgey people. They don’t pay your bills.

3.5. Tell yourself the truth: this could technically just be number 4, but that wouldn’t have been as catchy a title would it?
I posted a TikTok video about why a lot of affirmations don’t work for me (I know, how millennial of me). And this is because I know I’m lying to myself when I say them.
So I switched it up.
Now I say: “people do (this thing) all the time”.

And you can insert your desired thing in the middle. So, people write books all the time, people lose weight all the time, people cut off their toxic family members all the time.
Because it’s true. They do. Which means you can too.

So go forth.
Try these 3.5 (technically 4) things and smash that fear of failure in the **butt**.
